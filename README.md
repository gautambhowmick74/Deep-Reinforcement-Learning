# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

Use machine learning models running on a cloud environment to develop an autonomous trading bot. I’m going to use Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques for agents to trade in the financial (and cryptocurrency) markets can be an exciting topic for commercial investors.
The finance domain is vast and complex, so you can easily spend several years learning something new every day. In this project, I’ll scratch the surface a bit with Reinforcement Learning (RL) tools, and the problem will be formulated as simple as possible, using price as an observation. I will investigate whether it will be possible for an agent to learn when the best time is to buy one single share and then close the position to maximize the profit. The purpose of this project is to show how flexible the RL model can be and what the first steps are that you usually need to take to apply RL to a real-life use case.

To formulate RL, three things are needed: observation of the environment, possible actions, and a reward system
